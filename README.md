# [JS] Ray Casting 
> Ray Casting/Tracing in vanilla JS using the [P5 Library](https://p5js.org)

I wanted to attempt to ray trace/cast. With my limited knowledge in languages better suited for this. I decided to push myself, by doing such in a language that would be different. Proving to be a challenge, JS was the language of choice for my own use. ( My first public git hub project <3 )
